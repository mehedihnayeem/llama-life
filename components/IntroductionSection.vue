      üëã Hello, I'm Marie <br />
      your Chief Llama
    </p>

    <p class="my-3">
      I made Llama Life after I was
      <span class="font-bold">diagnosed with ADHD</span>, later in life as an
      adult. I just couldn't find a tool that worked how I wanted it to. There
      are plenty of tools that help you make lists, but I wanted something that
      would actually help me focus and work
      <span class="font-bold">through</span> my list.
    </p>

    <p class="my-3">
      To do this, Llama Life uses a concept called
      <span class="font-bold">'timeboxing'</span>, which is the practice of
      setting a fixed amount of time to each task. This creates
      <span class="font-bold">a useful constraint</span>, a finishing point to
      work toward (or a 'l- only-have-to-do-this-for-a-short-time' point to work
      toward). It also provides the
      <span class="font-bold">mental space to focus</span>, as it encourages you
      to tackle <span class="font-bold">one thing at a time.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="my-3">
      With Llama Life, my end goal was to create something that would provide
      <span class="font-bold">a feeling of calmness and control</span> to
      whoever used it. I hope I've achieved this, but I'm always looking for
      ways to improve so feel free to
      <span class="font-bold">drop me a line</span>d with any feedback or
      suggestions!
    </p>

    <p class="my-3">
      As for
      <span class="font-bold">why it's called Llama Life</span>...well, that
      comes from a trip I did to Peru in 2018. I was lucky enough to visit a
      small village, and chat with some of the locals there. They had no
      electricity or running water, but damn they had a lot of llamas! At the
      time, one thing that struck me was how peaceful, calm and content they all
      were, and when it came to naming this app, I wanted to replicate that
      feeling. And so..."Llama Life‚Äù was born.
